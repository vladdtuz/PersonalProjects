This is a read my file. 

This repository is designed to be a collection for projects currated by me 
(Vlad Turculetu). Main purpose of this repository is to keep me accountable
for continiously imporving myself in the area of  software and software 
development.

This repo will be updated on a continous basis , hopefully on a regular basis. 
 
First project, uploaded " IrisFlower.ipynb" :

kaggle. This is purely a data science approach to understading the database.
Not learning or prediction was done.
